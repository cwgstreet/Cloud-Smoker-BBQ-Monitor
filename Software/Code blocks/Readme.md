## Code Blocks

Given I'm new at Arduino coding, to make this task easier for me, I've decided to break down the overall project sketch into individual functions or code blocks before combining them into the overall project sketch.

The advantage of doing it this way to me is

1. I can concentrate on one action at a time 
2. Easier to learn, plus verify code block and debug if necessary
3. I can come back and easily pick up and re-use these code blocks in other projects without stripping them out of a larger sketch.

Note that as a novice, I'm borrowing heavily from existing code available on the net or in libary examples.  I've tried to give credit in the sketch headers.
